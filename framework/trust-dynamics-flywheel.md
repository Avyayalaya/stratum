# Flywheel Case Study: Trust Dynamics in Motion

## Situation
You’ve just been promoted to lead a cross-functional initiative across engineering, design, marketing, and sales. The project is high-profile but politically delicate:
- Engineering is overworked
- Marketing feels unheard
- Sales doesn’t trust the product roadmap
- Your own team is still adjusting to your new role

You have six weeks to deliver alignment and launch clarity.

This is where **Trust Dynamics** becomes your operating system.

---

## Step 1: Trust-Building
> “Who needs to feel seen, safe, and steady?”

You don’t push a new plan on day one. You:
- Run listening sessions with each group
- Surface old wounds without judgment
- Deliver two small but visible follow-throughs in week one

**Outcome:** You become the person who does what they say. A trust anchor.

---

## Step 2: Tribal Intelligence
> “What’s the real map—not the org chart?”

You:
- Notice that one IC, not the EM, is the trust node in engineering
- Realize design is aligned with marketing culturally, not structurally
- Understand sales responds best to stories, not numbers

**Outcome:** You begin building through the real social web, not the formal one.

---

## Step 3: Narrative Framing
> “What meaning are people giving this work—and how do I guide that?”

Instead of pushing strategy, you offer a new narrative:
> “This isn’t just a product launch. It’s our chance to prove we can deliver across silos—without burning out or blaming.”

You echo that in every meeting, thread, and summary.

**Outcome:** The team stops asking *what* to do, and starts rallying around *why it matters*.

---

## Step 4: Ability to Influence
> “How do I move people—without control?”

You:
- Win over skeptics by surfacing and respecting their past frustrations
- Use social proof by sequencing early alignment in private
- Pre-align objections so no one feels ambushed in public forums

**Outcome:** Approvals happen before meetings. Momentum starts to feel self-driven.

---

## Step 5: Confidence Calibration
> “How do I share clarity without overreach?”

You:
- Signal when you’re speaking from conviction vs. collaboration
- Defer openly when outside your scope, but with a framing lens
- Invite others to challenge assumptions without threatening the project

**Outcome:** People trust you—not because you’re always right, but because they know *how* right you think you are.

---

## Final Reflection
The team ships. Not perfectly—but on time, together, and with renewed confidence.

What changed? Not just the plan. The **trust scaffolding** underneath it.

This is Trust Dynamics in motion:
- Calm follow-through
- Subtle social mapping
- Clarity of meaning
- Movement without mandate
- Confidence without ego
