# Domain: Cognitive Mastery

## Purpose
Cognitive Mastery is the foundation of analytical strength, structured problem solving, and learning agility. It comprises meta-skills that help individuals operate with clarity, speed, and resilience in intellectually demanding or ambiguous environments.

## Meta-Skills in This Domain

### 1. **First Principles Thinking**
- **Definition**: The ability to break down problems into fundamental truths and reason from the ground up.
- **Why It Matters**: Enables clarity when navigating novel or complex issues where analogies or playbooks fall short.
- **Assessment**: Look for logical decomposition, originality, and resistance to convention.
- **Signals**: Challenges assumptions; builds solutions from base constraints.

### 2. **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty** *(See `decision-making.md`)*
- **Definition**: Making high-quality decisions with incomplete or conflicting data.
- **Why It Matters**: Most impactful decisions are made in fog. This skill enables velocity without recklessness.
- **Signals**: Structured risk framing, fallback planning, real-time adaptation.

### 3. **Mental Simulation**
- **Definition**: The ability to predict, rehearse, and explore outcomes internally before taking action.
- **Why It Matters**: Great strategists simulate systems in their head. Reduces trial-and-error risk.
- **Assessment**: Ask how they predict cascading consequences.
- **Signals**: Uses language like "I imagined if...", considers second- and third-order effects.

### 4. **Feedback Calibration**
- **Definition**: Rapidly iterating and learning from outcomes by adjusting based on input and reality.
- **Why It Matters**: Separates those who grow from those who plateau. The fuel of compounding improvement.
- **Signals**: Actively seeks feedback, changes direction, shows version history in thinking.

### 5. **Learning How to Learn**
- **Definition**: Acquiring the meta-cognitive ability to self-teach, adapt to new domains, and improve skill acquisition speed.
- **Why It Matters**: Futureproofs talent. In fast-moving fields, learning velocity beats accumulated knowledge.
- **Signals**: Self-taught competence across diverse domains, structured note-taking, repeatable learning loops.

## How to Evaluate Cognitive Mastery

### Team Assessment Tips:
- Run time-boxed problem breakdowns to evaluate First Principles Thinking.
- Simulate ambiguous scenarios for Decision-Making and Mental Simulation.
- Track feedback integration over multiple reviews for Feedback Calibration.
- Use personal learning audits and skill journaling for Learning How to Learn.

### Behavioral Signals:
| Meta-Skill | Strong Indicators |
|------------|------------------|
| FPT | Reduces noise to essentials, challenges assumptions |
| DMUU | Decides with speed and structure, tests assumptions |
| Simulation | Predicts consequences, thinks in systems |
| Calibration | Shows evolution in thought, adapts quickly |
| Learn2Learn | Applies cross-domain knowledge, improves learning speed |
