# Domain: Trust Dynamics

## What is Trust Dynamics?
**Trust Dynamics** is the domain of influence, alignment, communication, and collaboration. It governs how trust is earned, transferred, repaired, and expanded within teams and across systems.

This domain isn't about being liked—it's about being trusted, understood, and followed when it counts.

> "In systems under pressure, trust becomes the highest bandwidth protocol. When it flows, work accelerates. When it breaks, nothing else matters."
