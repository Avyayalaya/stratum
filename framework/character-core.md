# Domain: Character Core

## What is Character Core?
**Character Core** is the internal strength that enables composure, courage, and clarity in moments of stress, uncertainty, and pressure. It is the invisible force that steadies action when fear, ego, or fatigue threaten to derail it.

This domain reflects not just what a person can do—but who they choose to be when it matters.

> "You don’t rise to the occasion. You fall to the level of your systems—and character is the deepest system of all."

- Long-term trust and credibility
- Clear action under emotional volatility
- Leadership in ambiguous or high-stakes moments
- Resilience during failure, rejection, and adversity

## Coaching and Evaluation Suggestions
- **Decision Logs**: Track how people decide under pressure.
- **Pre-mortems**: Reveal patience vs. impulse.
- **Adversity Stories**: Ask for moments of rejection or failure—what happened next?
- **Ethics Scenarios**: Present moral ambiguity and watch how principles hold.
