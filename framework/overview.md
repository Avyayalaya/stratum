 
# Overview: Hiring, Evaluating & Scaling Elite Teams

Stratum organizes team growth into a simple loop:

1. **Hire for Meta-Skills**
   - Use the [Diagnostics](../evaluation-tools/cognitive-mastery-diagnostic.md) and [Scenario Decks](../scenario-templates/cognitive-scenarios.md) as part of your interview process.
   - Look for evidence of the behaviors described in the [Meta-Skill Domains](./cognitive-mastery.md).

2. **Evaluate & Develop**
   - Run diagnostics regularly and debrief using the [Flywheel Case Studies](./cognitive-mastery-flywheel.md).
   - Reinforce strengths with the [Field Notes](../coaching-playbook/cognitive-field-notes.md) and other playbooks.

3. **Scale with Trust**
   - Apply the [Character Core](./character-core.md) and [Trust Dynamics](./trust-dynamics.md) guides to build a culture that scales.
   - Revisit diagnostics each quarter to keep standards high as your team grows.

Following this cycle keeps hiring rigorous, evaluation consistent, and growth sustainable.
