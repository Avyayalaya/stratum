# Trust Dynamics Simulation Deck

## Purpose
These simulation scenarios are designed to surface real-time behaviors across the five meta-skills of **Trust Dynamics**. Each one presents ambiguity, pressure, and interpersonal complexity—revealing how well someone builds trust, earns influence, or shapes perception without direct power.

Use these for leadership training, hiring, performance debriefs, or cross-team trust calibration.

## Simulation 1: **The Uncredited Contribution**

**Target Skills:**
- Confidence Calibration
- Ability to Influence

### 🧠 Situation
You contributed the core analysis that unlocked a product breakthrough. During the leadership review, your manager presents it as a team effort—with no specific mention of your role. Your peers now think someone else led it.

### 🔍 Prompt
- Do you address it directly? When, how, and with whom?
- How do you express your value without diminishing trust?
- What would signal strength—not ego—to others?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
This isn’t about credit. It’s about **signal management**—what do people trust you for, and how clearly can you shape that without overplaying your hand?

## Simulation 2: **The Divided Room**

**Target Skills:**
- Tribal Intelligence
- Narrative Framing

### 🧠 Situation
You’re brought in to align marketing and product leads who haven’t collaborated well in months. Everyone agrees on the *goal*, but the vibe is cold and the language is subtly combative. You’re the only outsider.

### 🔍 Prompt
- What do you say in the room—and what do you hold?
- How do you use framing to shift tone without taking sides?
- How do you decide which group to build trust with first?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
Trust Dynamics isn’t about uniting everyone instantly. It’s about reading the social map and **moving energy through the right channel**.

## Simulation 3: **The High-Stakes Walkback**

**Target Skills:**
- Trust-Building
- Confidence Calibration

### 🧠 Situation
You made a high-conviction call during a leadership meeting last week. New data just came in—proving you were wrong. The impact is real, but not catastrophic. No one has mentioned it yet.

### 🔍 Prompt
- Do you bring it up? When and in what setting?
- What language do you use to model ownership and clarity?
- How do you reinforce trust—not erode it—through the correction?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
Credibility is rarely lost from being wrong. It’s lost from **being unclear about what being wrong means**.

## Simulation 4: **The Silent Team**

**Target Skills:**
- Narrative Framing
- Trust-Building

### 🧠 Situation
You lead a remote team. Recently, feedback loops have gone quiet. Standups are low-energy, async threads feel transactional, and retros are surface-level. You suspect people are withholding—but there’s no clear issue on record.

### 🔍 Prompt
- What story do you think the team is telling themselves?
- What narrative can you introduce to reset the tone?
- What’s the first small act that rebuilds psychological safety?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
Sometimes leadership is less about new action—and more about **resetting the shared narrative** of who we are and how we move.
