# Cognitive Mastery Simulation Deck

## Purpose
These simulation scenarios are designed to pressure-test an individual or team’s **Cognitive Mastery** in practice. Each one mimics a high-stakes, real-world decision environment with built-in ambiguity, tension, and time compression.

Each scenario targets multiple meta-skills, and includes:
- Situation brief
- Decision prompt
- Debrief questions
- Hidden insight(s) revealed at the end

Use them in coaching, leadership offsites, interviews, or async team development.

## Simulation 1: **The Preemptive Launch**

**Target Skills:**
- Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
- Scenario Thinking
- Feedback Calibration

### 🧠 Situation
You lead product at a Series A B2B SaaS startup. Your key competitor is rumored to be releasing a similar feature in the next 30 days. You’re 70% ready with yours, but QA isn’t complete and onboarding isn’t finalized. Sales is pushing hard to launch now to stay ahead.

You have 48 hours to decide: Launch now, delay, or release to a subset of accounts?

### 🔍 Prompt
- What key signals would make you confident enough to launch early?
- What could go wrong—and how would you know fast?
- How do you communicate risk to your sales and exec teams?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
There’s no perfect path. Any decision you make will cause friction. The real skill tested: Can you articulate **your assumptions**, **design for reversibility**, and **pre-wire internal trust** for the fallout?

## Simulation 2: **The Burnout Spiral**

**Target Skills:**
- Feedback Calibration
- Bayesian Updating
- Character Core crossover

### 🧠 Situation
You notice a high performer on your team is slowing down. They're missing subtle handoffs and seem disengaged in stand-ups. You ask for feedback; they say they’re “fine.” You sense something deeper but don’t have clear evidence.

You’re also under pressure to ship a release they own.

### 🔍 Prompt
- How do you probe without micromanaging?
- What signals would shift your assumptions?
- If you’re wrong, what’s the cost of over- or under-reacting?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
The real test isn’t identifying burnout—it’s **your sensitivity to weak signals** and whether you’re updating beliefs as new interpersonal evidence emerges. Teams break not from big misses—but from tiny missed recalibrations.

## Simulation 3: **The Contrarian Proposal**

**Target Skills:**
- First Principles Thinking
- Influence (from Trust Dynamics)
- Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

### 🧠 Situation
You’re in a roadmap planning review. Everyone aligns on a low-risk Q3 feature set. One team member proposes something unexpected: a risky integration that could 10x value—but is 3x the effort and 50% likely to fail.

Everyone looks to you.

### 🔍 Prompt
- How do you evaluate the reasoning behind their proposal?
- What assumptions must be true for it to succeed?
- How do you frame your response to preserve innovation, but maintain delivery focus?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
This isn’t about right or wrong. It’s about whether you can:
- **Deconstruct arguments to first principles**
- **Simulate multiple outcomes**
- **Lead visibly through intellectual tension**

---

## Simulation 4: **The Hiring Dilemma**

**Target Skills:**
- Bayesian Updating
- Feedback Calibration
- Scenario Thinking

### 🧠 Situation
You’ve championed a senior hire. They have a stellar resume and nailed the interview. You’re two weeks into onboarding, and subtle gaps are emerging:
- Team energy around them feels off
- Their deliverables are fine, but not outstanding
- You can’t tell if this is ramp time or misfit

### 🔍 Prompt
- What evidence do you collect before making a call?
- How do you calibrate your original conviction?
- If you needed to pivot, how would you do it with integrity?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
The simulation tests whether your belief system is brittle or adaptive. It’s easy to be convinced upfront. The real test: **Can you downgrade conviction in real time without ego or overcorrection?**

---

## How to Use
- Run these as timed group simulations or async written reflections.
- Always ask for confidence ratings and revision notes.
- End with: “What would you do differently if you could rerun this tomorrow with fresh eyes?”
