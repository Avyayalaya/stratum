# Character Core Simulation Deck

## Purpose
These simulations help individuals and teams practice the real-world application of **Character Core** under pressure. Each one mirrors emotionally charged, ethically ambiguous, or resilience-testing moments where internal strength becomes visible—or fails.

Each scenario includes:
- Context brief
- Interactive decision prompts
- Reflection questions
- Hidden insight(s) to reveal post-simulation

Use in leadership coaching, retros, team calibration, or onboarding for high-integrity roles.

## Simulation 1: **The Ethical Shortcut**

**Target Skills:**
- Strength of Character
- Strategic Patience

### 🧠 Situation
You’re in late-stage negotiations with a critical partner. The deal hinges on a performance claim your team made. You now realize the claim may be 20% off, but no one outside would notice. Legal says you're not legally liable—but ethically, it's gray.

### 🔍 Prompt
- Do you disclose the discrepancy?
- What language do you use?
- What risks are worth taking—or not?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
This isn’t about policy. It’s about what kind of leadership others learn from you in silence.

- Cognitive Decoupling

### 🧠 Situation
You’ve been in six weeks of crunch. Your last strategy call was flat. You missed a signal from a teammate. You feel disconnected, but you’re hiding it.

### 🔍 Prompt
- What do you do in the next 48 hours?
- Do you reveal how you’re feeling—or power through?
- What’s your bounceback plan?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
The test isn’t just recovery—it’s whether you let recovery **start** before damage spreads.

## Simulation 3: **Pressure to Punish**

**Target Skills:**
- Cognitive Decoupling
- Strength of Character

### 🧠 Situation
A direct report made a visible error that hurt a launch. You’re frustrated. Leadership wants to know what corrective action is being taken. Your impulse is to respond strongly.

### 🔍 Prompt
- How do you separate frustration from signal?
- How do you uphold accountability while preserving morale?
- What does your action teach others?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
What you reward and punish defines culture. Can you stay steady when others want retribution?

---

## Simulation 4: **The Reversible Bet**

**Target Skills:**
- Execution with Reversibility
- Strategic Patience

### 🧠 Situation
You’re proposing a bold change in process. You believe in it, but others are skeptical. You’re being asked: “What if this fails?”

### 🔍 Prompt
- How do you build in exit paths or kill switches?
- How do you explain the safety net without weakening confidence?
- What signal will cause you to pivot?

### 🧨 Hidden Insight
Reversibility isn’t fear—it’s **designed boldness**.
