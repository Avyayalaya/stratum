# Stratum: A Meta-Skill Framework for Building Great Teams

**Stratum** is a leadership framework designed for individuals and teams seeking to master the invisible skills that power high-performance collaboration. It helps you identify, evaluate, and grow the foundational behaviors behind clarity, resilience, trust, and influence.

This repository includes three fully scaffolded meta-skill domains, along with tactical tools, simulations, and flywheel case studies that bring them to life in real-world teams.

> **Why Stratum?**
> Because great teams aren't built on tactics—they’re built on thinking, character, and trust, practiced daily.

## 🧠 The Three Core Domains

Each domain includes 5 meta-skills, foundational documents, tactical playbooks, and live examples.

### 1. [Cognitive Mastery](./meta-skills/cognitive-mastery.md)
> *“Think clearly under uncertainty.”*

| Meta-Skill | Link |
|------------|------|
| [First Principles Thinking](./meta-skills/first-principles-thinking.md) | Break down problems to fundamentals |
| [Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](./meta-skills/decision-making.md) | Act without full information |
| [Scenario Thinking](./meta-skills/scenario-thinking.md) | Anticipate multiple futures |
| [Feedback Calibration](./meta-skills/feedback-calibration.md) | Integrate signal without distortion |
| [Bayesian Updating](./meta-skills/bayesian-updating.md) | Revise beliefs based on evidence |

### 2. [Character Core](./meta-skills/character-core.md)
> *“Stand tall when it’s hard to.”*

| Meta-Skill | Link |

| [Resilience](./meta-skills/resilience.md) | Recover and recommit |
| [Strength of Character](./meta-skills/strength-of-character.md) | Act with integrity under pressure |
| [Cognitive Decoupling](./meta-skills/cognitive-decoupling.md) | Think through emotion, not from it |
| [Execution with Reversibility](./meta-skills/execution-with-reversibility.md) | Move fast with optionality |

### 3. [Trust Dynamics](./meta-skills/trust-dynamics.md)
> *“Shape perception, build belief, and lead without mandate.”*

| Meta-Skill | Link |
|------------|------|
| [Trust-Building](./meta-skills/trust-building.md) | Be counted on under pressure |
| [Ability to Influence](./meta-skills/ability-to-influence.md) | Move people without power |

## 🧭 How to Use Stratum

### For Individuals:
- Diagnose your growth edges with the domain diagnostics
- Practice weekly using simulation decks and journaling from field notes
- Reflect using flywheels to trace your real-time behavior under pressure

### For Leaders:
- Use diagnostic tools in 1:1s, team offsites, or calibration sessions
- Facilitate simulations to surface real decision habits in a safe space
- Reinforce field notes as team rituals and micro-habits

### For Coaches:
- Run multi-domain assessments and debriefs for founders, leaders, or teams
- Coach meta-skill stacks relevant to the leader’s current challenge (e.g. patience + influence)
- Use flywheels to unpack real-world moments with high fidelity
