# Stratum: A Leadership Framework for Hiring, Evaluating, and Scaling Elite Teams

**Stratum** is a leadership framework for building elite teams. It focuses on hiring the right people, evaluating them on core meta-skills, and scaling a culture of trust and clarity. Use it to identify, assess, and grow the behaviors behind outstanding collaboration.

This repository includes three fully scaffolded meta-skill domains, along with tactical tools, interview simulations, and flywheel case studies that bring them to life in real-world teams.

> **Why Stratum?**
> Because great teams aren't built on tactics—they’re built on thinking, character, and trust, practiced daily.
