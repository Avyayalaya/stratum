# Stratum: A Playbook for Building Elite Teams

**Stratum** is a modular, system-first framework to evaluate, coach, and assemble high-performing teams based on meta-skills, real-world simulations, and dynamic decision-making patterns.

This playbook is designed to help leaders and builders think deeply about how teams *actually* perform under ambiguity, pressure, and growth—and how to make that performance repeatable.

## 🌐 What is Stratum?
Stratum is your cognitive and structural operating system for team-building. It moves beyond static org charts and job roles and focuses on:

- **Meta-skills** that drive long-term excellence (e.g., resilience, decision-making, learning how to learn)
- **Scenario-based evaluation** to simulate high-stakes environments
- **Agent-driven design** to help you build and evolve teams over time
- **Coaching loops** to turn skill gaps into growth plans

---

## 🧠 Meta-Skill Architecture
Stratum organizes foundational capabilities into three core domains:

### 1. Cognitive Mastery
- First Principles Thinking
- Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
- Mental Simulation
- Feedback Calibration
- Learning How to Learn

### 2. Emotional & Identity
- Strategic Patience
- Resilience
- Strength of Character
- Cognitive Decoupling
- Execution with Reversibility

### 3. Social & Relational
- Trust-Building
- Ability to Influence
- Narrative Framing
- Tribal Dynamics
- Circle of Competence

Each meta-skill comes with:
- Definitions
- Evaluation criteria
- Interview questions
- Scenario templates
- Coaching suggestions
