# Engineering Playbook

Quick checklist for applying Stratum within engineering teams.

## Key Meta-Skills
- **First Principles Thinking** – break systems down to their fundamental parts.
- **Scenario Thinking** – map failure paths before they become incidents.
- **Execution with Reversibility** – ship in small steps and keep rollbacks ready.
- **Confidence Calibration** – express uncertainty so decisions get better.
- **Trust-Building** – deliver reliably and close loops quickly.

## Team Rituals
- Architecture reviews anchored in first principles.
- Post-mortems focused on missed signals and lessons learned.
- Use feature flags or kill switches on every major launch.
- Hold a weekly "confidence round" on key technical decisions.
- Pair reviews to spread knowledge and build trust across the team.
