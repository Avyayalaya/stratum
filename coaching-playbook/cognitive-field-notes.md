# Stratum Field Notes: Applying Cognitive Mastery in Daily Work

## Purpose
These notes are designed to help you **operationalize Cognitive Mastery** across meetings, documents, decisions, and team rituals. It turns theory into tactical behaviors—and makes the flywheel visible in your workflow.

## 🔍 Microbehaviors to Watch and Practice

### First Principles Thinking
- In strategy docs: Strip goals down to constraints and truths.
- In meetings: Ask “What are we assuming?” before diving into solutions.
- In 1:1s: Help a teammate rebuild a stuck problem from scratch.

### Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
- In planning: Define “reversible vs. irreversible” upfront.
- In standups: Say “This isn’t final, but here’s my best call with current info.”
- In reviews: Track how past decisions aged—what was missing?

### Scenario Thinking
- In product design: List 3 failure paths in a shared comment.
- In leadership syncs: Ask “What happens if this goes better/worse than expected?”
- In ops: Build early signal checklists for common risks.

### Feedback Calibration
- In retros: Ask “What changed because of this feedback?”
- In 1:1s: Share your version of a plan, then invite a rewrite.
- In docs: Use changelogs to show evolution of ideas, not just final states.

### Bayesian Updating
- In status reports: Say what shifted in your model this week.
- In team learning: Run an “update ritual” where people share revised beliefs.
- In key meetings: Use confidence levels (“I’m 70% sure; here’s what would increase or decrease that.”)

## 🚦Common Anti-Patterns

| Meta-Skill | What to Watch For |
|------------|--------------------|
| First Principles | “This is how it’s always been” framing |
| Decision-Making | Overanalysis or frozen consensus loops |
| Scenario Thinking | Single-outcome bets, optimism bias |
| Feedback Calibration | Ignored retros, stale rituals, untracked change |
| Bayesian Updating | Inflexibility, or sudden flips with no logic trail |

## 🔁 Flywheel-Driven Team Rituals

| Ritual | How It Works |
|--------|---------------|
| **Uncertainty Check-Ins** | Ask: “Where are we making a bet with unclear data this week?” |
| **Signal Review Fridays** | Review 3 decisions: What signal came in? Did we update? |
| **Scenario Jam Sessions** | Rapid brainstorm: 3 future paths, 3 mitigations, 1 upside play |
| **Confidence Roundtable** | Go around: “What % confident are you in our plan—and what’s your margin?” |

---

## 📌 Summary
Cognitive Mastery isn’t just how you think—it’s how your thinking shows up in:
- The questions you ask
- The paths you simulate
- The decisions you make
- The updates you own

Build rituals. Reward clarity. Name the flywheel. And never stop evolving your models.
