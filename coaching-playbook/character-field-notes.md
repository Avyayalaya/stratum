# Stratum Field Notes: Applying Character Core in Daily Work

## Purpose
These field notes help individuals and teams operationalize the **Character Core** meta-skills through daily behaviors, team rituals, and situational awareness. They translate abstract strength into visible action.

## 🔍 Microbehaviors to Watch and Practice

### Strategic Patience
- In meetings: Pause before responding to pressure questions.
- In planning: Delay decisions without avoiding them—use intentional “hold” frames.
- In conflict: Ask, “Is now the right time to push?”

### Resilience
- In retros: Lead with “what we learned” before “what failed.”
- In 1:1s: Check in with energy and focus—not just delivery.
- Personally: Track bounceback time from disappointment or critique.

### Strength of Character
- In debates: Hold your ethical line with calm, not friction.
- In escalation: Choose truth over comfort—even if it creates noise.
- In culture: Speak clearly when values are at risk.

### Cognitive Decoupling
- In tension: Name emotion internally before deciding.
- In feedback: Reframe attack as input. Wait before reacting.
- In written comms: Don’t reply at emotional peak. Sleep on it.

### Execution with Reversibility
- In launches: Use toggles, kill switches, or phased rollout by default.
- In process: Time-box experiments. Always know how to revert.
- In messaging: Say, “Here’s how we’ll know if it’s working—and what we’ll do if not.”

## 🔁 Team Rituals to Reinforce Character

| Ritual | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Patience Audit** | Ask: “Where are we being rushed, and should we slow down?” |
| **Bounceback Check-In** | Ask: “What’s something that went wrong recently—how did we recover?” |
| **Integrity Spotlight** | Share examples of team members acting with integrity under pressure |
| **Decouple & Decide** | Take 15 min post-conflict to delay reactions; then reconvene |
| **Reversibility Planning** | Add one reversibility plan per roadmap item—who owns it, and how fast |

---

## Summary
Character Core shows up when no one is watching, when clarity is costly, or when your team needs courage more than control. These rituals and behaviors make that character visible, shareable, and teachable.
