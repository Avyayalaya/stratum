# Meta-Skill: Ability to Influence

## Domain
**Trust Dynamics**

## Definition
The Ability to Influence is the capacity to shape decisions, direction, and action—without relying on formal authority. It blends empathy, logic, framing, and credibility to move people toward shared conviction.

## Why It Matters
In high-functioning teams, most leverage comes from people who don’t “own the box.” Influence turns insight into momentum, builds alignment across silos, and powers change when the org chart can’t.

> “Authority pushes. Influence invites. Influence wins.”

## Example
A mid-level product manager believes the company is underinvesting in onboarding. Instead of escalating or complaining, they:
- Build a data-backed one-pager with a clear tradeoff narrative
- Socialize it quietly with design and support to gather feedback
- Win over a skeptical engineering lead with user friction stories
- Present the revised version in a QBR—with zero defensiveness

Leadership greenlights the initiative. Influence didn’t come from power. It came from **earned credibility and pre-alignment**.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Relies on escalation or emotion to be heard |
| **2 – Developing** | Conveys ideas clearly, but struggles to create momentum |
| **3 – Proficient** | Aligns peers and stakeholders consistently without formal authority |
| **4 – Advanced** | Shapes org direction through subtle alignment and shared logic |
| **5 – Expert** | Influences not just decisions—but thinking norms and team behavior |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Describe a time you shifted someone’s mind without positional power.”
- “How do you win support for something you believe in—but others aren’t yet aligned to?”
- “Tell me about a time when your influence failed—what did you learn?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Stakeholder Mapping | No clear strategy | Some pre-alignment | Actively sequences influence across the org |
| Empathic Framing | Pushes ideas | Frames for mutual benefit | Tailors logic and emotion per audience |
| Credibility | Relies on charisma | Some trust built | Relies on consistent delivery and earned belief |
| Momentum-Building | Needs help to execute | Rallies some support | Creates independent motion through trust and clarity |

## Simulation Template

### Title: The Idea That’s Not Yours

**Scenario:**
> You’re part of a multi-team initiative that’s stalling. You believe a colleague’s idea—previously dismissed—actually solves the core issue. Leadership is fixated elsewhere. You have one week before priorities lock.

**Prompt:**
- How do you resurface the idea without ego friction?
- How do you align others without credit-grabbing or awkwardness?
- What signal would tell you you’ve earned momentum?

### Evaluation Tips:
- Do they signal generosity while being outcome-driven?
- Are they strategic about when and how to engage others?
- Do they understand influence as **pull**, not push?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Practice influence journaling: track outcomes from different approaches
- Shadow influential peers and map their behaviors
- Assign influence loops: win small support on something they care about

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Run stakeholder map + sequence simulations
- Practice mutual benefit framing in meetings
- Assign doc-writing that frames for skeptical audiences

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Let them lead quiet pre-alignment in cross-org efforts
- Coach others on “invisible architecture of buy-in”
- Involve them in major shifts where tone and timing matter
