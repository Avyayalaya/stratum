# Meta-Skill: Strength of Character

## Domain
**Character Core**

## Definition
Strength of Character is the ability to act with integrity, conviction, and moral clarity—especially when it’s inconvenient, unpopular, or ambiguous. It’s about holding your line when it matters, even without applause.

## Why It Matters
When stakes are high and rules are unclear, your values are your compass. Strength of Character ensures that your actions reflect principles—not pressure. It builds trust, credibility, and internal alignment across time.

> “When no one’s watching, and the outcome is unclear—Strength of Character decides what you do.”

## Example
A head of product is told to inflate projections to secure an internal budget. They:
- Decline the request, even when it risks exec approval
- Offer a grounded alternative scenario
- Escalate with calm clarity when pushed

They preserve trust with their team and become the person others confide in. That’s not compliance. That’s Character in action.

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time you stood alone for what you believed.”
- “What line won’t you cross, even under pressure?”
- “When did you last make a hard call that cost you politically?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Moral Clarity | Avoidant | Selectively principled | Consistently aligned under pressure |
| Courage | Avoids tension | Holds discomfort briefly | Acts despite risk or cost |
| Integrity | Flexible under scrutiny | Mostly consistent | Fully trusted even when unseen |
| Influence | Invisible character | Silent role model | Becomes a standard others follow |

### Title: Do the Right Thing When It Hurts

**Scenario:**
> Your team discovers a bug that affects a major customer’s usage data. It’s unlikely to be noticed. Disclosing it may lead to reputational or financial loss. Legal says disclosure is optional. Leadership is split.

**Prompt:**
- What do you decide—and why?
- How do you explain it to both customer and execs?
- What signal are you sending to your team?

### Evaluation Tips:
- Are they clear about values, not just optics?
- Do they take ownership beyond the minimum?
- Is their stance steady without self-righteousness?
