# Meta-Skill: Narrative Framing

## Domain
**Trust Dynamics**

## Definition
Narrative Framing is the ability to shape how others interpret events, decisions, and intent by constructing clear, coherent, and emotionally resonant stories. It transforms information into meaning—and ambiguity into alignment.

## Why It Matters
In fast-moving environments, the story *about* the decision often travels faster than the decision itself. People follow stories more than instructions. Framing is how leaders:
- Win alignment without debate
- Guide energy during uncertainty
- Connect dots that others don’t yet see

> “Facts inform. Framing mobilizes.”

## Example
A team misses a quarterly goal by 12%. Instead of blaming execution or hiding behind metrics, the team lead:
- Frames the miss as the **cost of a bold bet** that validated a new user segment
- Shows how the insights fuel the next roadmap phase
- Positions the next 90 days as a “compound return period” from hard learning

The result: no loss of morale. No loss of credibility. The team doubled down—not because of the numbers, but the story.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Relays facts without context or leaves room for misinterpretation |
| **2 – Developing** | Sometimes shapes meaning, but inconsistently or reactively |
| **3 – Proficient** | Regularly frames key moments to align teams and reduce noise |
| **4 – Advanced** | Anticipates narratives before they form and directs interpretation |
| **5 – Expert** | Consistently defines meaning at scale—shapes culture through language |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time you had to reframe a bad outcome into a productive message.”
- “How do you shape perception when decisions are unpopular or misunderstood?”
- “What’s the most important narrative in your team/org right now?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Signal vs. Noise | Shares only what happened | Shares outcomes and intent | Shapes understanding with clarity and context |
| Emotional Tone | Unaware or defensive | Reasonable tone | Frames tension with steadiness and resonance |
| Audience Fit | Generic or self-focused | Reasonably aligned | Tailored to what the listener *needs to believe* to act |
| Cultural Impact | Doesn’t register | Some localized effect | Drives shared language and organizational meaning |

## Simulation Template

### Title: “You Missed the Target—Now What?”

**Scenario:**
> Your team missed a key milestone that impacts other functions. The delay is defensible—but morale is shaky and senior leadership wants answers. You’re asked to present an update at Friday’s all-hands.

**Prompt:**
- What narrative do you craft for your team?
- How do you ensure other stakeholders don’t see this as incompetence?
- What’s the one idea you want the company to remember after your update?

### Evaluation Tips:
- Do they create psychological safety without sugarcoating?
- Do they reframe failure as part of forward motion?
- Do they narrate through **meaning**, not just mechanics?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Practice writing post-mortems in narrative form
- Identify key “moments that needed framing” retroactively
- Role-play reframing under tension—especially in ambiguity

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Assign storytelling exercises: “Make a miss meaningful”
- Use before/after examples of real org comms
- Run team-wide “narrative of the month” sessions to anchor context

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Let them run high-stakes update briefings
- Use their language to reinforce values or cultural tone
- Invite them to mentor new leaders in shaping shared perception
