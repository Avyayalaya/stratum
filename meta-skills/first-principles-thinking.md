# Meta-Skill: First Principles Thinking

## Domain
**Cognitive Mastery**

## Definition
The ability to break down a problem into its most basic, non-negotiable truths and reconstruct a solution from the ground up. It replaces convention with clarity.

## Why It Matters
Most decisions and systems are built on layers of assumptions. First Principles Thinking allows you to:
- Escape outdated playbooks
- Find novel solutions in uncertain environments
- Identify what truly matters when tradeoffs multiply

> "When you can’t copy-paste from precedent, you have to think from first principles."

## Example
**SpaceX and the cost of rockets**: Instead of accepting that rockets must cost millions, Elon Musk asked: What are the raw materials of a rocket? Can we source and assemble them differently? That thinking led to SpaceX’s radically cheaper launch systems.

**This is First Principles Thinking.** It's the skill of simplifying the complex by breaking it down into elemental truths, and building upward—not sideways.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Relies on analogies, convention, or authority. Doesn’t question base assumptions. |
| **2 – Developing** | Occasionally challenges defaults, but often defaults to known paths. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Identifies and tests assumptions when stakes are high. Can deconstruct moderately complex problems. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Regularly reasons from first principles across functions. Able to simplify deeply. |
| **5 – Expert** | Creates clarity in chaos by reconstructing ideas from foundational truths. Teaches others to do the same. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time when you challenged a default or assumption in your team.”
- “How would you explain your role or product to someone who’s never heard of it—without using industry jargon?”
- “How do you know when a commonly held belief is no longer serving you?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Assumption Awareness | Blind to defaults | Identifies some assumptions | Surfaces hidden drivers consistently |
| Problem Decomposition | Accepts surface framing | Breaks into sub-parts | Reframes problem from core truths |
| Rebuilding Logic | Relies on convention | Mix of original + inherited logic | Synthesizes novel paths from primitives |
| Communication Clarity | Jargon-heavy | Reasonably clear | Elegant simplicity |

## Simulation Template

### Title: Market Entry without Precedent

**Scenario:**
> You’re asked to lead an expansion into a market with no direct competitor analogues. Budget is tight. No one’s done this before.

**Prompt:**
- How do you determine what users truly need?
- What assumptions from past launches can you discard?
- How do you structure a plan from zero?

**Evaluation Tips:**
- Does the person stay high-level, or go atomic?
- Are assumptions questioned out loud?
- Do they seek signal over precedent?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Assign “assumption audits” in live projects
- Run backward reasoning drills
- Practice simplifying known problems to atomic components

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Introduce thinking tools (e.g., inversion, Socratic questioning)
- Review foundational works in their domain
- Assign teardown memos: rebuild known system from scratch

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Let them coach team strategy from zero
- Include in “what if we started fresh?” initiatives
- Pair them with systems thinkers to go deeper
