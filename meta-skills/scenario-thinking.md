# Meta-Skill: Scenario Thinking

## Domain
**Cognitive Mastery**

## Definition
Scenario Thinking is the ability to mentally simulate multiple possible outcomes before taking action. It helps individuals forecast consequences, anticipate edge cases, and stress-test decisions against uncertainty.

## Why It Matters
Decisions don’t fail in the moment—they fail in the future. Scenario Thinking enables you to:
- See around corners
- Identify blind spots
- Avoid overly optimistic, linear planning

> “One decision, many futures. Scenario Thinking is how you see what might go wrong—before it does.”

## Example
**A logistics lead is asked to implement same-day delivery in a new city.** Instead of jumping to operations, they simulate:
- Scenario A: Surge demand on Day 1 overwhelms capacity
- Scenario B: No orders come in due to marketing lag
- Scenario C: 30% deliveries fail due to terrain and routing errors

They build systems to detect and adapt in real time for each. That’s Scenario Thinking—it maps possibility space before committing resources.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Acts on single-track planning. Misses edge cases. |
| **2 – Developing** | Aware of risk but thinks in binary outcomes. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Simulates 2–3 plausible paths. Prepares fallback. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Models outcomes dynamically across time and systems. |
| **5 – Expert** | Thinks like a strategist—time-horizon aware, feedback-loop sensitive, probabilistically structured. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Describe a time when things didn’t go as expected. Could you have foreseen it?”
- “When you’re facing a big decision, how do you evaluate risk?”
- “Walk me through how you’d plan for a launch with multiple unknowns.”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Outcome Coverage | Thinks linearly | Considers some variation | Simulates edge cases and second-order effects |
| Contingency Thinking | Reactive | Prepares some backup plans | Designs with optionality and thresholds |
| Signal Awareness | Ignores leading indicators | Reacts to events | Monitors early warning signals and triggers |
| Communication | Unclear plans | Reasonable explanation | Shares scenarios clearly to align others |

## Simulation Template

### Title: Feature Launch with Uncertain User Impact

**Scenario:**
> You’re launching a new UI change to 100,000 users. You’ve tested it on a small group, but results are mixed. There’s pressure to ship now.

**Prompt:**
- What are the top 3 possible outcomes post-launch?
- What early signals will tell you which path you’re on?
- What would your rollback or pivot path look like?

**Evaluation Tips:**
- Do they identify non-obvious failure paths?
- Do they assign probabilities or signal thresholds?
- Do they prepare realistic monitoring plans?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Use retrospective simulations: “How could this have gone differently?”
- Run pre-mortem workshops before launches
- Introduce first-order vs. second-order thinking

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Teach simple frameworks: red-teaming, probabilistic branching
- Assign future-back planning tasks
- Practice forecast journaling with feedback loops

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Lead scenario planning across teams or functions
- Embed into product or strategy reviews
- Teach use of time-boxed simulations for team rituals
