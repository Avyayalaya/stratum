# Meta-Skill: Resilience

## Domain
**Character Core**

## Definition
Resilience is the ability to recover, re-engage, and learn after setbacks—whether internal (self-doubt, fatigue) or external (failure, rejection, crisis). It’s not just about endurance; it’s about *bounceback with clarity*.

## Why It Matters
Setbacks are inevitable. What separates high-agency leaders is not how rarely they fail, but how quickly and precisely they recover. Resilience fuels iteration, protects momentum, and keeps teams from spiraling when stakes are high.

> “Resilience is not just staying upright—it’s rising faster and wiser every time you fall.”

## Example
A mid-level manager rolls out a new performance system. Within a month, engagement drops, and feedback is brutal. Instead of retreating or blaming, they:
- Interview critics with openness
- Scrap half the rollout
- Redesign based on real concerns
- Relaunch a better version 3 weeks later

The team’s trust improves—not because it was perfect, but because the leader **owned, adjusted, and returned**.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Takes failure personally. Energy and clarity collapse. |
| **2 – Developing** | Recovers inconsistently. Tends to isolate under pressure. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Regroups within days. Reflects and iterates with support. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Rebounds predictably. Brings others along in the recovery. |
| **5 – Expert** | Uses failure as raw material. Models recovery as a cultural norm. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time you got knocked down—what did you do next?”
- “How do you restore energy when momentum is lost?”
- “What’s your protocol after something breaks?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Recovery Speed | Slow, emotional | Consistent | Swift, grounded, visible |
| Reflection Depth | Defensive or avoidant | Reasonable post-mortem | Clear learnings, behavioral change |
| Emotional Energy | Depletes quickly | Manages okay | Regenerates and sustains others |
| Cultural Contribution | Internalizes only | Shares lessons | Builds team norms from failure |

## Simulation Template

### Title: Public Failure, Private Response

**Scenario:**
> You pitched a major vision in front of execs. It flopped—confusion, pushback, no clear path forward. Your team is looking to you to reset. You’re unsure whether the strategy was flawed or just poorly received.

**Prompt:**
- What do you do in the first 24–72 hours?
- How do you diagnose what really went wrong?
- How do you show up for your team and leadership next?

### Evaluation Tips:
- Do they stay emotionally steady, or deflect?
- Are there signs of real-time learning?
- Do they frame next steps with confidence *and* humility?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Use structured post-mortems on low-stakes failures
- Practice narrative reframing: from defeat to lesson
- Create energy rituals (physical, emotional, mental)

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Lead recovery messaging for team retrospectives
- Journal bounceback timelines + identify accelerators
- Assign reading around adaptive recovery (e.g., anti-fragility)

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Coach others in managing emotional crash cycles
- Model public recovery post-failure for the org
- Build “failure playbooks” into team norms
