# Meta-Skill: Trust-Building

## Domain
**Trust Dynamics**

## Definition
Trust-Building is the ability to create consistent psychological safety, mutual respect, and credibility through reliable action, emotional steadiness, and transparent intent. It is the **core currency** of high-functioning teams.

## Why It Matters
Without trust, there is no velocity. Teams slow down to protect themselves, leaders speak past each other, and feedback turns to silence. Trust-Building is not about being liked—it’s about being believed, relied on, and followed.

> “Trust builds when what you say matches what you do—even when it’s hard.”

## Example
A newly appointed leader inherits a fractured team with low morale and high turnover. Instead of rushing to fix output, they:
- Spend the first 3 weeks running 1:1s to learn what broke trust
- Share a summary of themes, with a public commitment plan
- Deliver 3 key low-friction wins in 30 days without overpromising
- Create a weekly cadence where progress is visible, not just stated

By month two, feedback loops reopen, and cross-team handoffs smoothen. Trust wasn’t requested—it was rebuilt through presence, pattern, and follow-through.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Inconsistent. Overpromises or disappears in tension. |
| **2 – Developing** | Reliable in low-stakes; wavers in crisis. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Steady, accountable, transparent across most contexts. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Builds trust across silos. Sought after for clarity and presence. |
| **5 – Expert** | Acts as institutional stabilizer. Others anchor on their word and tone. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “When did someone lose trust in you—and how did you handle it?”
- “Describe a time you had to rebuild credibility.”
- “How do you keep teams calm when things break?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Consistency | Unreliable | Reasonably dependable | Highly predictable under stress |
| Transparency | Avoidant | Some clarity | Shares full context early and openly |
| Presence in Tension | Evades or escalates | Manages okay | Brings calm clarity in storm |
| Repair Capability | Avoids or delays | Basic follow-up | Rebuilds broken trust visibly and fast |

## Simulation Template

### Title: The Missing Owner

**Scenario:**
> You’ve joined a project midway. It’s politically sensitive, three weeks late, and full of tension between engineering and product. You’re asked to take over. No one truly trusts each other—and execs expect a recovery plan by Friday.

**Prompt:**
- What’s the very first message you send?
- How do you diagnose what people are really worried about?
- What are the first trust signals you deliver within 72 hours?

### Evaluation Tips:
- Do they recognize that **trust precedes action**?
- Are they focused on signal restoration—not just execution?
- Do they avoid big claims and instead deliver steady micro-wins?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Practice “trust journaling”: What did I say I’d do? Did I do it?
- Simulate visible failures in safe spaces, then reflect
- Use shadowing to observe trusted leaders in action

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Role-play hard news delivery and escalation drills
- Build default comms templates for stress scenarios
- Track follow-up behavior to surface integrity gaps

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Let them own comms in ambiguous moments
- Invite them to coach others post-incident
- Ask them to document “how I build trust under pressure” guides
