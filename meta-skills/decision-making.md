# Meta-Skill: Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

## Domain
**Cognitive Mastery**

## Definition
The ability to make sound, timely decisions with incomplete, ambiguous, or conflicting information—while balancing risk, speed, and reversibility.

## Why It Matters
Most critical decisions are made without perfect clarity. This skill separates high-leverage operators from hesitant executors. It's the backbone of leadership, innovation, crisis management, and product strategy.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Hesitates in the absence of full data. Over-indexes on consensus or safety. |
| **2 – Developing** | Begins to frame risks but often defers to authority or over-analyzes. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Makes timely calls using rough data and basic risk tradeoffs. Updates decisions post-feedback. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Anticipates unknowns, calibrates decisions using mental models, and communicates confidence bands. |
| **5 – Expert** | Rapidly synthesizes ambiguity into high-leverage decisions. Coaches others through uncertainty. Demonstrates reversibility instinctively. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time you made a high-stakes decision with partial information.”
- “How do you know when to stop analyzing and decide?”
- “What’s the worst call you’ve made? How would you redo it today?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Clarity Under Pressure | Confused | Mostly clear | Articulate, calm |
| Risk Framing | Avoidant | Basic tradeoffs | Sophisticated balancing |
| Speed vs. Accuracy | Frozen | Tradeoffs explicit | Operates with clarity and urgency |
| Framework Usage | None | Basic heuristics | Advanced mental models |
| Adaptability | Rigid | Updates slowly | Rapid iteration and recalibration |

## Simulation Template

### Title: AI Product Rollout with Conflicting Feedback

**Scenario**:
> You lead a cross-functional team. Your AI-based feature had mixed pilot results: 10% power users love it, but 30% are confused. Marketing is ready to launch. Engineering sees scaling risk. You have 48 hours to decide: Launch now, delay, or limit exposure?

**Prompt:**
- What are your options?
- What risks are you managing?
- How do you test your assumption post-decision?
- If it fails, what’s your rollback plan?

**Evaluation Tips:**
- Look for decision ownership, clarity of thinking, fallback planning.
- Penalize perfectionism or false confidence.

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Practice scenario walk-throughs with time-boxed decision-making.
- Teach reversible vs. irreversible decisions.
- Share decision logs and post-mortems.

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Introduce mental models (e.g., Expected Value, OODA Loop).
- Run simulations with constrained data.
- Pair with a mentor to shadow real-time decisions.

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Let them coach others in ambiguous decisions.
- Give them edge-case problems where tradeoffs are non-obvious.
- Encourage writing public or internal breakdowns of major decisions.
