# Meta-Skill: Tribal Intelligence

## Domain
**Trust Dynamics**

## Definition
Tribal Intelligence is the ability to read, navigate, and lead within the invisible structures of human groups—identity, belonging, status, loyalty, and informal power. It is how you operate fluently within and across trust networks, especially when logic alone won’t move people.

## Why It Matters
Most decisions are social before they’re rational. Teams are not spreadsheets—they are tribes with norms, loyalties, and emotional histories. Tribal Intelligence lets you:
- Detect who holds real influence—even without a title
- Shape decisions through belonging, not mandate
- Cross silos without breaking trust

> “Trust flows through invisible networks. Tribal Intelligence maps those currents—and moves through them without friction”

## Example
You’re parachuted into a project with three competing stakeholders. Officially, everyone agrees on goals—but underneath, there’s tension. Instead of charging in:
- You observe who people defer to in side threads
- You map where safety, status, and resentment live
- You meet 1:1 with the quietest voices first
- You adjust your language to match each tribe’s values

Within 10 days, you’ve realigned the group—without ever saying, “Let’s realign.” That’s Tribal Intelligence: subtle fluency in the system behind the surface.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Misses group signals. Treats everyone as rational individuals only. |
| **2 – Developing** | Aware of some social dynamics, but misreads key cues. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Navigates group energy well, spots informal influence. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Shapes tone and behavior to sync across tribes. Resolves unspoken tension. |
| **5 – Expert** | Builds bridges across high-conflict groups. Defines norms through subtle actions. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time you entered a politically sensitive environment. What did you observe first?”
- “When have you helped two groups collaborate that didn’t trust each other?”
- “What signs tell you when you’re not part of a group’s trust circle yet?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Social Awareness | Misses group dynamics | Recognizes some influence lines | Maps unspoken power and trust flows |
| Adaptability | One-size-fits-all tone | Some language adjustment | Mirrors norms without losing self |
| Integration Skill | Stays outsider | Gains partial access | Builds bridges between silos and circles |
| Conflict Navigation | Avoids or escalates | Calms visible tension | Resolves root cultural misalignment |

## Simulation Template

### Title: Ghosts in the Room

**Scenario:**
> You’re leading a kickoff between marketing, product, and sales. On paper, everyone agrees. In the meeting, subtle jabs and side-eyes hint at deeper tension. You’re not sure why, but delivery depends on them aligning.

**Prompt:**
- What do you pay attention to in the next 30 minutes?
- How do you decide whether to confront it now or follow up?
- What do you say—and to whom—to shift the energy?

### Evaluation Tips:
- Do they notice subtle cues, not just explicit words?
- Are they fluent in *emotional tone + informal hierarchy*?
- Do they create movement without escalation?

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Practice mapping unspoken org influence webs
- Debrief meetings based on “what wasn’t said”
- Pair with team whisperers to build observational muscle

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Assign invisible influence case studies
- Role-play status-based tension with live feedback
- Track how tone shifts trust in cross-team comms

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Use them as pre-aligners in fragile group initiatives
- Assign onboarding buddy roles for cultural decoding
- Document “how to enter this tribe” guides for new hires
