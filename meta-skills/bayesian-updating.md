# Meta-Skill: Bayesian Updating

## Domain
**Cognitive Mastery**

## Definition
Bayesian Updating is the ability to continuously refine your beliefs, expectations, or strategies in proportion to the strength of new evidence—without overreacting or clinging to outdated assumptions.

## Why It Matters
In dynamic, ambiguous environments, the best decisions are rarely made once. This skill lets you:
- Evolve thinking as data emerges
- Avoid bias from anchoring, ego, or false certainty
- Make small updates instead of sweeping pivots

> “Strong opinions, loosely held—Bayesian Updating is how you hold them correctly.”

## Example
An AI strategy lead believes that users prefer transparency in model decisions. But user feedback reveals confusion, not confidence. Rather than abandoning the idea or ignoring input, she:
- Revises the mental model: transparency ≠ understanding
- Narrows the hypothesis: visual cues + summaries help more than full logs
- Iterates messaging and UI accordingly

This isn’t a reversal—it’s a principled update. Bayesian Updating enables learning **without flipping or freezing.**

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Novice** | Clings to original beliefs regardless of input. |
| **2 – Developing** | Updates sporadically, often under social pressure. |
| **3 – Proficient** | Adjusts beliefs when presented with evidence; avoids overcorrection. |
| **4 – Advanced** | Applies structured updating in thinking and planning. |
| **5 – Expert** | Models likelihoods, tracks confidence shifts, and leads with humility. |

## Evaluation Framework

### Behavioral Interview Questions
- “Tell me about a time your initial take was wrong—what changed your mind?”
- “How do you revise your strategy when new data challenges your plan?”
- “How do you balance conviction with flexibility?”

### Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Update Frequency | Rarely adjusts | Learns post-fact | Updates mid-process or preemptively |
| Evidence Sensitivity | Biased or dismissive | Reactive to strong signals | Responsive to nuance and signal quality |
| Confidence Management | Overconfident or scattered | Balanced | Ranges confidence transparently with others |
| Meta-Awareness | Fixed mindset | Reflects post-outcome | Builds deliberate learning loops |

## Simulation Template

### Title: Strategy Pivot With Emerging Evidence

**Scenario:**
> You're advocating a product roadmap direction. Three weeks in, usage data and anecdotal reports begin to challenge your assumptions—but your team is already aligned to the original plan.

**Prompt:**
- What do you do?
- How do you evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio?
- How do you communicate a shift without appearing indecisive?

**Evaluation Tips:**
- Look for change proportionality (not panic or rigidity)
- Assess logic behind belief revision
- Watch language: transparency vs. hedging

## Coaching Recommendations

### For Low Scores (1–2):
- Teach anchoring bias and availability heuristics
- Practice writing confidence-weighted bets
- Reflect on 3 past decisions and when updates should’ve happened

### For Mid Scores (3):
- Use probability estimation in product planning
- Run “if X changes, what else should change?” reviews
- Assign “update memos” post new signal arrival

### For High Scores (4–5):
- Lead red-teaming and probabilistic planning sessions
- Teach others signal-quality filters and prior/posterior updates
- Write “Learning Position Papers” after each major decision
