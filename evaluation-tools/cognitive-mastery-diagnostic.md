# Cognitive Mastery Diagnostic

## Purpose
This diagnostic helps individuals and teams evaluate their current strength across the five core meta-skills of **Cognitive Mastery**. It enables:
- Self-awareness for personal growth
- Peer feedback in coaching environments
- Team-level visibility on capability gaps

---

## Format
Each section contains 5 statements (one per meta-skill). Rate each from **1 (Strongly Disagree)** to **5 (Strongly Agree)**.

## ✅ Self-Assessment Prompts

### 1. First Principles Thinking
- I regularly question the assumptions behind our decisions.
- I can explain ideas without relying on jargon or convention.
- I enjoy breaking complex problems down to core truths.
- I often ask: “If we had to rebuild this from scratch, how would we do it?”
- I prefer clarity over precedent when solving new problems.

### 2. Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
- I make sound decisions even when data is incomplete.
- I clearly articulate risks and tradeoffs before acting.
- I’m comfortable choosing without perfect consensus.
- I revisit key decisions based on new signals.
- I know when a decision is reversible and act accordingly.

### 3. Scenario Thinking
- I mentally simulate multiple possible outcomes before committing.
- I prepare for edge cases—not just the most likely path.
- I build fallback plans when risks are uncertain.
- I monitor for early indicators that a scenario is unfolding.
- I can explain future possibilities clearly to others.

### 4. Feedback Calibration
- I actively seek feedback—even when it’s uncomfortable.
- I update plans quickly when real-world signals emerge.
- I separate signal from noise when interpreting feedback.
- I treat being wrong as a learning opportunity.
- I close the loop after acting on input.

### 5. Bayesian Updating
- I revise beliefs proportionally to evidence strength.
- I can shift direction without appearing indecisive.
- I regularly estimate confidence, not just outcomes.
- I reflect on how my thinking has evolved over time.
- I balance conviction with humility.
