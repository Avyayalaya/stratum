# Trust Dynamics Diagnostic

## Purpose
This diagnostic helps individuals and teams assess their real-world strength across the five core meta-skills of **Trust Dynamics**. It reveals how effectively you build, sustain, and operate within trust-based systems—across stakeholders, functions, and influence paths.

Use this to:
- Evaluate your trust-building presence and influence precision
- Identify blind spots in how others perceive your input and leadership
- Reflect after tense cross-functional work or critical moments

---

## Format
Rate each statement on a scale of **1 (Strongly Disagree)** to **5 (Strongly Agree)**.
