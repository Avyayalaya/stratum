# Character Core Diagnostic

## Purpose
This diagnostic helps individuals and teams evaluate their capability across the five core meta-skills of **Character Core**. It builds self-awareness around how one shows up under pressure, handles ambiguity, and sustains trust through action.

Use this to:
- Identify growth areas in emotional regulation and ethical clarity
- Reflect on performance after key leadership moments
- Calibrate team character strengths during high-stakes periods

---

## Format
Rate each statement on a scale of **1 (Strongly Disagree)** to **5 (Strongly Agree)**.
